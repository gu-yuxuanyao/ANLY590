# ANLY590 Final Project **[Final Project](https://github.com/gu-yuxuanyao/ANLY590/tree/master/Final%20Project)**

# Introduction

This project is about our ANLY590 (Deep Learning) course.

The main purpose of this project is to classify the speech audio files.

# Process

We mainly followe these steps to do this project: 
1. data visualization [Data Visualization](https://github.com/gu-yuxuanyao/ANLY590/blob/master/Final%20Project/final_processing.ipynb)
2. data preprocessing [Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/gu-yuxuanyao/ANLY590/tree/master/Final%20Project/Data%20Preprocessing)
3. Buildin deep learning models [Data Modeling](https://github.com/gu-yuxuanyao/ANLY590/tree/master/Final%20Project)
